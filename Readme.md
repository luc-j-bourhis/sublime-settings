# Sublime Text settings for all my machine

This repository is very unlikely to be useful to anybody else than me. It might provide a bunch of examples though.

## Installation

This is the directory "Packages/User" inside Sublime Text settings. Its exact location depends on the OS.

* Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text
* MacOS: TODO
* Windows: TODO
